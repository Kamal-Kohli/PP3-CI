## Overview
Welcome to the Battleship Game! This repository houses a classic naval strategy game implemented in [Python programming language](https://github.com/Kamal-Kohli/naval-war-pp3/blob/main/run.py), which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku app. Battle it out on the high seas, strategize your moves, and sink your opponent's ships. Test your strategic skills against a smart AI opponent in this engaging and interactive Battleship experience.

## How to play
Naval war game is based on the classic pen and papper game. You can read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).

In this version, the player enters their name and two boards are randomly generated side by side.

The player can se where their ships are, indicated by "S" alphabet, but cannt see where the opponent's ships are.

Gusses are marked on the board with "#". Hits are indiated by "X".

The player and the opponent then take it in turns to make gusses and try to sink each other's naval ships.

The winner is the player who sinks all of their opponent's naval ships first.
